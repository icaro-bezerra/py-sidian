,100 Days Note,,,,,,
,"100 days is just a little over 3 months and I don't believe 3 months is truly sufficent to ""become a data engineer"" or at the very least it feels a little fast. There is no need to rush. The real purpose of this 100 days is to get you into the habit of practicing. If aftwards you want to dig into specific subjects, do that! Don't let this 100 days limit you. ",,,,,,
